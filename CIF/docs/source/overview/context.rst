Research institutes have developed various atmospheric inversion systems based on different approaches
(regarding e.g. transport model, optimization algorithms, assumption for the inclusion of prior information on the surface fluxes),
each having its own strengths and weaknesses.
Although referenced in peer-reviewed publications and usually accessible across the research
community, these systems are not at the level of transparency, flexibility and accessibility needed to provide
the scientific community and policy makers with the most comprehensive and robust view of the
uncertainties associated with the inverse estimation of GHG fluxes. Their development, usually carried out by
individual research institutes, may in the future not keep pace with the scientific/technical needs to come,
such as those to inject the increasing availability of high resolution satellite GHG observations.

The Community Inversion Framework (CIF) is an initiative by members of the atmospheric inversion community
to bring together the different approaches, models and inversion systems used in the community.
The objective is to benefit from the best of each system, while optimizing dissemination and development efforts.

The CIF is built to run with different atmospheric transport models, regional and global, Eulerian and
Lagrangian. This capability will allow errors due to modelled transport to be assessed in a fully consistent
framework. A longer-term objective is also to integrate complex schemes needed for FFDAS.

The CIF is designed as a flexible, transparent and open-source tool to estimate the fluxes of different GHGs both at
global and regional scales. It combines the best features of existing inversion frameworks and pool efforts
for its continued update and revision keeping it state-of-the-art.
